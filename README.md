#Curve Flow
===========

CurveFlow aims to reduce unintentional difficulty spikes in games by restructuring the content of a game to better suit a specific player's needs. It doesn't aim to just reduce the difficulty for less skilled players, rather it will move things around to better accomodate their strengths and weaknessess. 

Features
--------

- Tracks values such as a Player's competency at certain skills and can determine the best content for them to play based on those numbers.
- Customizable curve that allows for automatic highs and lows in the difficulty for good flow.
- Group Selection, allowing for CurveFlow to build sets for you such as full encounters.

Installation
------------

CurveFlow can be hooked into any project or game engine that supports .NET 3.5 DLLs. Download the DLL and hook it up however your engine requires.
* In **Godot** C#, simply add the DLL as a reference in the project settings
* In **Unity**, drag the DLL into the project and it will import itself
