Top down roguelike, emphasis on magic.

Can hold 2 offensive spells + your dodge and catch

Mana
Offensive Spells cost mana
Restored over time or by catching and consuming projectiles

Catching
Doesn't need to be aimed, all projectiles in an AOE around you are caught and put into a single ball of energy
Can be consumed for mana or shot for a high damage free attack.
Mana/damage is based on the projectile caught. Same ratio for both

Upgrades:
New Spells
	New spells you find can be higher level to encourage swapping
	Possibly can get upgrades for current spells?
Mana/Health up
Dodge/Catch upgrades
